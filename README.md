###  Project Overview

This project applies **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** using **ORCA 6.0.0** to simulate and analyze:

- Molecular structure and conformational energy (e.g., butane)
- IR spectra and vibrational modes of water clusters
- Thermodynamic behavior of (H₂O)₁₅ across temperatures
- Hydrogen bonding energy and O–H force constants
- Progressive solvation of NaCl with 1–41 water molecules
- Reaction mechanisms via NEB-TS for CH₃OH + HCl → CH₃Cl + H₂O

All computations were post-processed using Python in Google Colab, with structural inputs from **Avogadro** and visualizations in **Chemcraft**.
